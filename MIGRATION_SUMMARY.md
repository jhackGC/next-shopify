# Server-Side Authentication Migration Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed Migration

We have successfully moved all Shopify Customer Account API interactions to the server side for enhanced security. Here's what was implemented:

### üîß Server-Side Components Created

1. **`/src/lib/server-customer-api.ts`** - Server-side customer authentication logic

   - PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) implementation
   - OAuth2 token exchange
   - Customer data fetching
   - Secure token handling

2. **Next.js API Routes** - Server endpoints for authentication

   - `/api/auth/login` - Initiates PKCE and redirects to Shopify
   - `/api/auth/callback` - Handles OAuth2 callback and token exchange
   - `/api/auth/logout` - Clears authentication cookies
   - `/api/auth/me` - Returns current authenticated customer

3. **`/src/contexts/ServerAuthContext.tsx`** - Client-side context that communicates only with server
   - Uses fetch to call server API routes
   - No direct Shopify API calls from client
   - Secure state management

### üîí Security Improvements

- **No sensitive credentials exposed to client**: All customer API interactions happen server-side
- **Secure HTTP-only cookies**: Authentication tokens stored securely
- **PKCE implementation**: Protection against authorization code interception attacks
- **Server-side token validation**: All customer data fetching happens on server

### üßπ Cleanup Completed

- Removed old `AuthContext.tsx` and `auth.ts` files
- Updated all components to use new `ServerAuthContext`
- Cleaned up client-side Shopify library (`client-shopify.ts`)
- Updated environment variable documentation

### üìù Environment Variables

#### Server-Only (Secure)

```env
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_storefront_token
SHOPIFY_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_ID=shp_xxxxx
SHOPIFY_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret_key
SHOPIFY_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT_API_URL=https://shopify.com/xxxxx/account/customer/api/unstable/graphql
NEXT_AUTH_SECRET=your_secure_random_string_for_jwt_signing
```

#### Client-Exposed (Public Identifiers Only)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_storefront_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### ‚úÖ Build Status

The application builds successfully with no TypeScript errors. The 401 errors during build are expected when using placeholder credentials.

### üöÄ Next Steps

To test the authentication flow:

1. **Set up real Shopify credentials** in `.env.local`
2. **Configure Customer Account API** in your Shopify Partners Dashboard
3. **Add redirect URI** pointing to your callback endpoint: `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/auth/callback`
4. **Test the full authentication flow** by clicking the login button

### üéØ Benefits Achieved

- **Enhanced Security**: No customer API credentials exposed to client
- **OAuth2/PKCE Compliance**: Industry-standard secure authentication
- **Server-Side Token Management**: Tokens never leave the server
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between server and client concerns
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for production deployment with secure practices

The application is now following security best practices with all sensitive authentication logic safely contained on the server side.
